- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rider712
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about FPV drones and I'm just beginning.
I currently know very little.  A neophite.  I would like to at least know enough to ask simple questions.  But I'm getting there.

I'm also trying to learn more about how to use Github.  When I first became aware of Github, I was researching how to obtain clean, unfiltered, raw data, of even 
data tables reguarding Covid.

rider712/rider712 is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
